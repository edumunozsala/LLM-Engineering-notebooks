# Lectures notes and Notebooks - LLM Engineering Foundations
 
 ### WORK IN PROGRESS

 Some notebooks and notes, I developed during the LLM Engineering Course:

- *Custom GPT Model*: A notebook showing you how to train a GPT model to write like shakespeare.
- *Supervised fine-tuning of GPT-2*: From an unsupervised trained GPT-2 model to a supervised fine-tuned model to translate from text to SQL.
